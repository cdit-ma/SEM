# MEDEA v3.4.3

## Jenkins Integration
* deploy_model execution dialog will now prevent running experiments when the name is left empty
* deploy_model execution dialog will default to naming experiments "untitled_experiment"

## Analysis (Pulse/Charts)
* Min/max values shown near chart axis when hovering over the chart will now display the min/max values for the axis, rather than the min/max value of the data
* [BugFix] Requesting experiments should no longer fail for all experiments when no experiment name exists, just those that have no name
* [BugFix] Marker Event end-to-end durations (generated by the marker function in the UtilityWorker) should once again be visualised
