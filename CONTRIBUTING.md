# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any dependencies that are introduced will work on all supported build platforms
2. An effort should be made to ensure tests exist that will exercise any changes that have been made.
   Broadly speaking, the test coverage of the codebase should only increase with each contribution.
3. If end users or other contributors will be affected by any changes introduced in the Pull
   Request ensure that there is documentation to communicate the relevant details. Such
   documentation should exist within either the README.md or the wiki.
4. Check whether any of the files that have been modified are versioned, and if so make sure that
   the version number is updated appropriately. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
5. Pull Requests will be reviewed and merged by an active project Maintainer. The
   Maintainers reserve the right to request amendments or dismiss the Pull Request if it does not align
   with the core vision for the project.

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
